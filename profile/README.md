[Mapy.cz](https://mapy.cz/) is a Czech web and mobile mapping application developed by Seznam.cz, offering worldwide map coverage, route planning, and additional features for tourists and drivers. Developers can integrate Mapy.cz data and functionalities into their applications using the following tools:

## [**REST API Mapy.cz**](https://developer.mapy.cz/en/rest-api-mapy-cz/)

The REST API provides access to various mapping functions, enabling integration into web, mobile, or desktop applications. Key features include:

* [**Map Tiles**](https://developer.mapy.cz/en/rest-api-mapy-cz/function/map-tiles/): Access raster map tiles to create interactive maps.  
* [**Static Maps**](https://developer.mapy.cz/en/rest-api-mapy-cz/function/static-maps/): Retrieve images with maps and additional layers based on selected parameters.  
* [**Geocoding**](https://developer.mapy.cz/en/rest-api-mapy-cz/function/geocoding/): Perform forward and reverse geocoding, including address validation and conversion between addresses and coordinates.  
* [**Routing**](https://developer.mapy.cz/en/rest-api-mapy-cz/function/routing/): Plan routes and utilize matrix routing functionalities.  
* [**Elevation**](https://developer.mapy.cz/en/rest-api-mapy-cz/function/elevation-api/): Obtain elevation data for specific locations.
